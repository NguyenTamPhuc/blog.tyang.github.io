Last Friday, as part of the Squared Up UK community workshop, I have presented my recommended resources for SCOM and OMS. I have covered may blogs, sites, management packs and other utilities for SCOM and OMS.

I know that many friends have mentioned my work and myself in many occasions in the past, but I have never really "returned" any favours. So after the presentation on Friday, I’ve decided to share my slide deck here, hopefully, you’ll find something useful from it.
