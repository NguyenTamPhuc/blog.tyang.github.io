Last Saturday, I presented the topic of “What’s New in OMS” at the Global Azure Boot Camp 2016 Melbourne event. I have recorded it using Camtasia and uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUhrbj4C_JM">YouTube</a>. You can watch it here:

You can also download the slide deck from <a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Whats-New-in-OMS.pdf">HERE</a>. When I was editing the recording, I noticed that I might not placed the lapel microphone properly as it was rubbing my collar and you will notice the some noise in the video. Oh well, something to improve next time.
