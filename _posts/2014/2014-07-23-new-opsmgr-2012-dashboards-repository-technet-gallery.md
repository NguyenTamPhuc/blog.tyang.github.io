With the recent release of OpsMgr 2012 SP1 UR6 and R2 UR2, number of new dashboard widgets have been made available. The PowerShell Grid Widget and PowerShell Web Browser Widget are 2 of my favourite ones.

Microsoft has just created a new repository for the community to share their scripts and dashboards. This repository is located in the TechNet Gallery Script Center. You can access it from this direct link: <a href="http://bit.ly/Wy168U">http://bit.ly/Wy168U</a>. or go to the <a href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter">script center</a> and browse to: <b>System Center &gt; Operations Manager Dashboards:</b>

Looks like the product team has already posted 4 samples in the first day. In the next few days, I will also post few of mine to this place. I encourage everyone to keep eye on this place from now on, and please do not hesitate to share your work with the community!
