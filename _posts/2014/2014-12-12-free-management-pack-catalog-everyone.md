In the 2 most recent post, I have blogged my experience setting up a Microsoft OpsMgr MP catalog using SharePoint and SMA. I managed to produce 2 versions:
<ul>
	<li>On-Premise Version: Using SharePoint 2013 and SMA (System Center Service Management Automation)</li>
	<li>Off-Premise (Cloud) Version: Using Office 365 SharePoint Online and Azure Automation</li>
</ul>
As I mentioned at the end of the second post, I was working with my SCCDM MVP friend <a href="https://twitter.com/dankregor">Dan Kregor</a> to create this MP catalog on <a href="http://sparqconsulting.com.au/">Sparq Consulting</a>’s public SharePoint site – Free for everyone.

I am pleased to announce, everyone can now access this catalog from this URL:
<h2><a title="http://sharepoint.sparqconsulting.com.au/mpcatalog" href="http://sharepoint.sparqconsulting.com.au/mpcatalog">http://sharepoint.sparqconsulting.com.au/mpcatalog</a></h2>
<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/image23.png"><img class="" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/image_thumb23.png" alt="image" width="693" height="380" border="0" /></a>

This catalog is publicly available, no login is required. Consider it as a Christmas gift from us <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" />.

This catalog is hosted on SharePoint Online, and I have scheduled the Azure Automation runbook to run daily at 9:00pm of my local time to Synchronise with Microsoft’s MP Catalog (It’s Australia Eastern Standard Tiime).

If you like what we’ve done for the System Center community, please help us by spreading the words around, and we will be much appreciated if you want to link to this URL from your websites.

Lastly, other than Dan Kregor, I’d also like to thank all OpsMgr focused MVPs who’s been involved in this discussion since beginning. Thank you for all your input and feedback.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Merry Christmas, everyone.</strong></span>
