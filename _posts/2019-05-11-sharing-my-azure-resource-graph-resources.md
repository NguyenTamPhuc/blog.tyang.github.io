I have created a public GitHub repo to store and share resources I created around Azure Resource Graph:

<a href="https://github.com/tyconsulting/AzureResourceGraph">https://github.com/tyconsulting/AzureResourceGraph</a>

I have add queries, scripts I have developed over the last few months, as well as few how-to articles. I will continue updating this repo whenever I have developed new contents to add.

Feel free to clone it, fork it, and submit issues, PRs if youâ€™ve spotted any errors.
