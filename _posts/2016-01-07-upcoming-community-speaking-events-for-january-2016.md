I am going to speak at 2 community events in January 2016.

On 8pm <strong>Wednesday 13th Jan</strong> (Dutch time, which is going to be 6am Thursday Melbourne time), I am presenting a session on OMS Alerting and Alert Remediation in a webinar hosted by Windows Management User Group Netherlands (WMUG NL). Since it is a free webinar, everyone can register. If you are interested, you can find the registration details here: <a title="http://wmug.nl/2015/12/23/wmug-nl-webinar-1-january-13th-2016-introduction-to-oms-alerting-hosted-by-tao-yang/" href="http://wmug.nl/2015/12/23/wmug-nl-webinar-1-january-13th-2016-introduction-to-oms-alerting-hosted-by-tao-yang/">http://wmug.nl/2015/12/23/wmug-nl-webinar-1-january-13th-2016-introduction-to-oms-alerting-hosted-by-tao-yang/</a>

On 6pm <strong>Tuesday 19th Jan</strong> (Melbourne local time), I am presenting a session on how to write your own PowerShell modules for SMA and Azure Automation at the Melbourne PowerShell user group (hosted by MVP <a href="https://twitter.com/david_obrien">David Oâ€™Brien</a>). This is only a local event, so if you are a PowerShell fan and live in Melbourne, please feel free to attend this free event.
