I have kept the same theme on this WordPress blog since day 1. It has been 4 years and I started getting sick of it. Especially that picture of an old iPhone on the top of the page. I finally got around to update the theme today.

I’ve also changed the site title to a more suitable one: “Tao Yang’s System <strong>Center</strong> Blog”.

Special thanks to my wife – The background picture was taken by her using her Nikon D90 in Fiji few years ago.

Bye bye to the old look,

<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image23.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image_thumb23.png" alt="image" width="684" height="222" border="0" /></a>

Sometimes I wish there are more artistic gene in me. I’m still not 100% satisfied with the look, but this is the best I can do for now.
