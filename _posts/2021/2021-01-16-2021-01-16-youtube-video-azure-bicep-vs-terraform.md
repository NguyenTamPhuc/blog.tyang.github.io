summary: Azure Bicep Vs Terraform video on AzureTar's YouTube channel
---
[AzureTar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3FS96NUdoR3DwkaDwiLdRw) is a YouTube Channel focuses on all aspect of Azure. It's hosted by Jorge Arteiro ([@JorgeArteiro](https://twitter.com/JorgeArteiro)) and Fernando Rolnik ([@FernandoRolnik](https://twitter.com/FernandoRolnik)).

Jorge and I have known each other for few years since Jorge was an Azure MVP before he joined Microsoft. We are both living in Melbourne, and right now Jorge and I are team mates working on the same project. When Jorge asked me to become a guest in their AzureTar YouTube channel few months ago, I happily accepted offer. So far we have produced a number of videos already.

Yesterday, we got together and produced another video with the title [**Azure Bicep vs Terraform Overview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exk1QIRwAhU). This is something I've wanted to do for a while and now that we are still on the Christmas and New Years holidays, I finally had time to prepare the material and record it. In this video we have discussed the differences and similarities between [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/azure/bicep) and Terraform based on our experiences with Bicep and Terraform:
