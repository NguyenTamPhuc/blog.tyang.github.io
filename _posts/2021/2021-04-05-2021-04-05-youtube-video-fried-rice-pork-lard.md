Well, it's the long Easter weekend and I have done something different today - I created my first cooking video! In this video I demonstrated how to cook my favourite fried rice with pork lard.

It is very common to use pork lard instead of vegetable oil when cooking Chinese food. I initially wanted to post this on my wife's new YouTube cooking channel but she refused, so I've published it on my own channel instead. I hope you like it.
