<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MCSErgb_1460.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1942" alt="MCSE(rgb)_1460" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MCSErgb_1460.png" width="252" height="80" /></a>Yesterday, I completed the last exam: 70-247: Configuring and Deploying a Private Cloud with System Center 2012. With all the previous exams that I took over last few months, I’m now a MCSE: Private Cloud.

Being technical in I.T industry means I always have to keep myself up to date with the latest technologies and certifications. 2012 in particular has been very busy for me. Firstly, I became a dad in June, 2012. Secondly, we can all recall how many products that Microsoft has released in 2012! I started studying and preparing for exams around March, April 2012 during my spare time. Now, just a little bit over 1 year, I have completed the following exams during this period:

<strong>70-243</strong>: Administering and Deploying System Center 2012 Configuration Manager

<strong>70-410</strong>: Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012

<strong>70-411</strong>: Administering Windows Server 2012

<strong>70-412</strong>: Configuring Advanced Windows Server 2012 Services

<strong>70-246</strong>: Monitoring and Operating a Private Cloud with System Center 2012

<strong>70-247</strong>: Configuring and Deploying a Private Cloud with System Center 2012

With these exams, I’ve earned 3 certification:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS): Administering and Deploying System Center 2012 Configuration manager</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate: Windows Server 2012</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert: Private Cloud</strong></li>
</ul>
In terms of taking exams, it should be done and dusted for me for a while (unless Microsoft releases other System Center related certificates in the near future).

<strong>What’s next?</strong>

There are few books that I really want to have a good read, i.e. SCOM 2012 unleashed book and the upcoming Orchestrator Unleashed book. I’m also planning to start working on updating the OpsMgr Self Maintenance management pack very shortly. And with the System Center 2012 upgrade project at work, I will definitely still be very busy.
