Over the last few days, it seems my blog has been hacked. some suspicious malware codes have been injected into the WordPress PHP pages.

I have just reinstalled WordPress, changed all the passwords and ran another scan. it came out clean. I have manually checked infected pages, the suspicious codes have bee removed.

If you are using Google Chrome and saw the warning page when trying to access my blog:

<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image3.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" width="580" height="256" border="0" /></a>

I have requested Google to review my site again. Hopefully Iâ€™ll get my site removed from the blacklist within few days.
