As many of you may already know, the legendary System Center Universe franchise has been merged with ExpertsLive, which is also a popular community event over in Europe. As the result, the upcoming SCU Australia has been renamed to ExpertsLive Australia. Unlike last year, instead of just an one-day event, it is going to be a two day event, with 3 tracks: Cloud, Data Center and Enterprise Client Management. ExpertsLive Australia 2017 is going to be held at Crown Promenade Melbourne on 6th and 7th of April.

I will co-present 2 sessions with my friend and MVP veteran Pete Zerger (<a href="https://twitter.com/pzerger">@pzerger</a>). Our topics are:

1. Discoverying and monitoring your network topology using OMS
2. Cloud Based Automation Overview

There are many local and international speakers have already been confirmed, such as Alex Verkinderen, James Bannan, Thomas Maurer, Marcel Zehner, David Obrien, and more!

Make sure you check out the event website: <a href="http://www.expertslive.org.au">http://www.expertslive.org.au</a> and hopefully Iâ€™ll see you all there!
