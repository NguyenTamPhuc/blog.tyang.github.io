Over the last few months, Stan, Pete, Anders and I have been very busy with writing the version 2 of the Inside Microsoft Operations Management Suite book. Although we still have few more chapters to finish, we have decided to release 3 preview chapters now.

The first preview chapter was released yesterday. It was Chapter 6: Extending OMS Using Log Search (<a title="http://insidethecloudos.azurewebsites.net/early-chapter-preview-of-inside-oms-version-2/" href="http://insidethecloudos.azurewebsites.net/early-chapter-preview-of-inside-oms-version-2/">http://insidethecloudos.azurewebsites.net/early-chapter-preview-of-inside-oms-version-2/</a>). This chapter was written by myself, and reviewed by my MVP buddy Kevin Greene (<a href="https://twitter.com/kgreeneit">@kgreeneit</a>) and Pete himself. This chapter has covered several OMS functionalities that are based on Log search:

* Saved Searches
* OMS Computer Groups
* Custom Fields
* Custom Logs
* Power BI integration

Since there aren’t many documentations out there on for OMS Power BI integration feature, I have specifically spent a lot of time on the Power BI integration feature, it makes up about half of this 73-page chapter.

I must say that Kevin has done a fantastic job reviewing this chapter. Kevin’s review was really thorough, when I got Kevin’s feedback, it literally blew my mind! So special thanks to Kevin and Pete for their effort reviewing this chapter.

Lastly, the next 2 preview chapters will be released shortly. Please keep eye on Pete’s blog (<a title="http://insidethecloudos.azurewebsites.net" href="http://insidethecloudos.azurewebsites.net">http://insidethecloudos.azurewebsites.net</a>).
