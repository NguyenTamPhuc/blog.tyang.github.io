I have been asked to contribute to the <a href="http://bit.ly/100DaysOfIaC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 Days of IaC in Azure</a> project started by Ryan Irujo (<a href="https://twitter.com/reirujo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@reirujo</a>) and Pete Zerger (<a href="https://twitter.com/pzerger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@pzerger</a>). I accepted the invitation and have already contributed 4 articles for this project.

Right now we are not even half way through the 100 articles yet, Iâ€™m planning to continue contributing in the coming weeks.

Both Pete and Ryan are extremely talented in this field, I am very pleased to be part of this awesome project.
