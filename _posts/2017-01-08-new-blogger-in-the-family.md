I have been blogging for six and half years and to this moment, I’m still enjoying it. Few months ago my better half has decided to start blogging as well. Although my partner also works in IT as a project manager, her real passions are photography and cooking. She has decided to start a blog focused on food and recipes. By doing this, not only she gets to create her favorite dishes, she also gets to take pictures too.

Then there was a lot of preparation to get her started. I helped her registered her chosen domain name, got a WordPress site hosted on the same hoster as my blog and company website, and also bought a lot of cooking, photo and recording equipment. Now her site is up, and she has already posted 4 recipes. You can check it out on <a href="http://www.lemontaste.com.au">http://www.lemontaste.com.au</a>

You can also follow her on the social media:

Please feel free to share the links with your friends and family, it will be much appreciated!

For those who know me and my partner well on a personal level, hopefully you all agree that she is amazing when comes to cooking. Even my 4 year old daughter said to me that “Daddy is a cook, Mummy is a chef!” Together, we have already come up with over 20 recipes that she can blog about. However, given the time and effort required for each blog post, unlike my blog articles, she won’t be able to blog as fast as me. But I promise that I’ll keep reminding her and help her to get them published one at a time. At the end of the day, I really enjoy these blog posts too because I get to eat the leftover from her blog posts – after the photos been taken, then it’s all mine!

Here are some of her most recent dishes (all photos were taken by herself), there are few more on her blog:
