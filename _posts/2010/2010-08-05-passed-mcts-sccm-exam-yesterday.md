In the last couple of weeks, I've been refreshing my memory on SCCM since I haven't worked on it for almost 4 month... Yesterday, I passed Microsoft 70-401 (SCCM) exam with the score of 976/1000. Pretty disappointed that didn't get 1000 though...

Oh well, there are some SCCM work coming up at work, can't wait to get started!
