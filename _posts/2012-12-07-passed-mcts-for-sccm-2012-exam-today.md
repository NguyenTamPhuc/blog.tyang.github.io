Around 8-9 months ago, a friend of mine gave me a copy of beta version of trainer’s handbooks for Microsoft course 10747A (Administering SCCM 2012) and 10748A (Deploying SCCM 2012). I normally don’t read any Microsoft course materials as I always found better books out in the market.

When I was given these books, there weren’t any SCCM 2012 books available because SCCM 2012 wasn’t even RTM’d at that time. So I started reading these trainer’s handbooks and surprisingly, I found they are actually really good.

With everything else going on at work, all the SCOM stuff I’ve been doing outside of work and with the arrival of my baby girl Rosie in June this year, it took me about 9 months to finish reading these 2 course materials and completed all the labs at home (7 books in total).

So few days ago, I booked the SCCM 2012 exam (70-243) for this morning and I’ve passed the exam. This is probably the exam I’ve prepared for the longest time (now I understand what is like to be a parent <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />).

I’ve also bought the 2 SCCM 2012 books that are currently available:
<ul>
	<li>Mastering System Center 2012 Configuration Manager</li>
	<li>System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Unleashed</li>
</ul>
I only had time to read couple of chapters of the Unleashed book before the exam. it’s definitely much better and going much in depth than the trainer’s handbook that I’ve been reading. I’m sure I will finish reading it in the near future.

For anyone preparing for the exam, I strongly recommend you go grab a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/System-Center-Configuration-Manager-Unleashed/dp/0672334372">this book</a>.
