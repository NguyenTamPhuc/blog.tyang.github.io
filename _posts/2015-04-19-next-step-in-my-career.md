Back in September 2011, after a short and unpleasant contracting experience, I joint a large Australian retailer as a senior systems engineer, focusing on their System Center infrastructure. I chose this company because the office location is close to home, the role was interesting (have a VERY large System Center environment to play with), and my wife and I were expecting a baby so I thought a permanent role suited me better. Now looking back the 3.5 years I have spent there, I have involved in multiple System Center implementation and upgrade projects, written countless amount of management packs, trained many of my colleagues in various System Center products, and most importantly, continued blogging on this blog and earned my System Center Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP title.

Like all good things come to an end, I have realised it is time for me to move on and I have tendered my resignation 2 weeks ago. My last day as a full time employee there is Friday 1st of May 2015.

Last year, shortly after I became a MVP, I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attempted</span> to partner with another MVP to start a company called Sparq Consulting. Unfortunately, Sparq never took off and worked out for me. Until this date, it is still nothing but a verbal agreement. I have no legal obligation nor signed any contracts with Sparq. Therefore, I have decided to separate from Sparq and become an independent / freelance consultant.

After meeting with my accountant, I was told I need to register a company. As I am very bad with names, my wife suggested me to just use my initials as company name. Therefore, I named my company <strong><a href="http://www.tyconsulting.com.au">TY Consulting</a></strong>.

Moving forward, I am still going to keep blogging on this blog, but in order to help myself promoting TY Consulting, any new tools such as management packs, modules, scripts etc. will be released under TY Consulting and download links will be provided from it’s website <a href="http://www.tyconsulting.com.au">www.tyconsulting.com.au</a>. Over the last month or so, I’ve been working on an OpsMgr management pack that enables OpsMgr users to synchronise the health state from a monitoring object managed by a remote management group. I have already released this management pack on <a href="http://www.tyconsulting.com.au">www.tyconsulting.com.au</a>, I will write about it in the next blog post shortly after this.

Lastly, and most importantly, for all the folks out there in the broader System Center community, please <strong>DO</strong> contact me when you are looking for System Center consultants, I am now open for business!
