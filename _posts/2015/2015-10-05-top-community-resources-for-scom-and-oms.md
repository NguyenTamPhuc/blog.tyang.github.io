Last Friday, as part of the Squared Up UK community workshop, I have presented my recommended resources for SCOM and OMS. I have covered may blogs, sites, management packs and other utilities for SCOM and OMS.

I know that many friends have mentioned my work and myself in many occasions in the past, but I have never really "returned" any favours. So after the presentation on Friday, I’ve decided to share my slide deck here, hopefully, you’ll find something useful from it.

You can download it from the link below:
