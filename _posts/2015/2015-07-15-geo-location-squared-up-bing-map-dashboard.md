Before I started working for Squared Up, the very first project we talked about was producing Bing Maps dashboard in Squared Up.

I started working on this project after I finished the OpsMgr Data Warehouse Health Check script. And I'm please to announce we have just published the Bing Maps Dashboard solution on Squared Up's website: <a title="http://squaredup.com/geo-location-of-scom-objects-within-squared-up-map-dashboards/" href="http://squaredup.com/geo-location-of-scom-objects-within-squared-up-map-dashboards/">http://squaredup.com/geo-location-of-scom-objects-within-squared-up-map-dashboards/</a>

These are some of the sample dashboards I produced in my lab:

<strong>Example #1: World Map (Multi-Objects):</strong>

<strong>Example #2: Australia Map (Multi-Objects):</strong>

<img src="http://squaredup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map2.png" alt="Map2" width="680" height="353" />

<strong>Example #3: Melbourne Aerial Map (Multi-Objects):</strong>

<img src="http://squaredup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Map3.png" alt="Map3" width="684" height="376" />

<strong>Example #4: Single Object Street Map (of my local pub):</strong>
