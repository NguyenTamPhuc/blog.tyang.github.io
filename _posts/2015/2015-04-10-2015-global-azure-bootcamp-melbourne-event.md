For those who are actively engaged in Microsoft System Center and Azure community may already aware that there is a global Azure Bootcamp event taking place later this month (April 2015).

This year, the Azure bootcamp is going to be held at 195 confirmed locations on Saturday 25th April. More information about this global event can be found here: <a title="http://global.azurebootcamp.net/" href="http://global.azurebootcamp.net/">http://global.azurebootcamp.net/</a>

My fellow SCCDM MVP Daniel Mar is the organizer for the Melbourne event. Daniel has already put a great effort in organising this event (BIG thank-you to Daniel), and we now have a great line-up for Melbourne – with totally 11 MVPs presenting:

Please checkout the event site <a title="http://melbourne.azurebootcamp.net/" href="http://melbourne.azurebootcamp.net/">http://melbourne.azurebootcamp.net/</a> for sessions details. This is a free event, please register if you’d like to attend. (please note the available spots are limited, so, please only register if you are certain that you will be attending),

Lastly, we acknowledged 25th April 2015 is the 100th anniversary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Day">ANZAC day</a>. In order to respect the Australian and New Zealand soldiers, we have looked at the possibilities of changing the event day for Melbourne, but unfortunately, given it is a part of a global event, we are unable to do so. However, we will show respect to the fallen soldiers by reciting Ode of Remembrance and play the Last Post.
