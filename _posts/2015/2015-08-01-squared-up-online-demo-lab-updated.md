Squared Up has recently updated their online demo lab, with some new dashboards and features to show case:

In addition, they have made this demo lab open access to everyone, meaning you don’t need to register and provide any details in order to access it if you don’t want to. As they explained to me:
>We are well aware that the daily lives of IT engineers are blighted by the sales teams of highly aggressive vendors who leap on any casual interest and deluge them with calls and emails. That’s why we put all our pricing online, so there’s no mystery and absolutely no need to talk to sales guys unless you actually want to.

So, if you haven’t used or played with Squared Up dashboards, you can access their demo lab by simply going to this address:
