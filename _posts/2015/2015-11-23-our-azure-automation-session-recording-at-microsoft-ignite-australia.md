Last week, I had an opportunity teamed up with the legendary CDM MVP Pete Zerger (@pzerger) and delivered a session on Azure Automation at Microsoft Ignite Australia in Gold Coast, Queensland. Our session was the first session right after the opening keynote, so while some other sessions are still waiting to be uploaded to Channel 9 at the moment, our session has already been published. You can watch the recording here:

I have also published all the sample runbooks and other information on Github:
