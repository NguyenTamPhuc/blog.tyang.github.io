The biggest community event for System Center would have to be System Center Universe (SCU). This conference is currently conducted in 3 different continent: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Next year, it is coming down to Melbourne as part of the SCU APAC event. The SCU Australia event is going to take place on the <strong>11th March 2016</strong> at Crown Casino, Melbourne.

Other than the Australian based System Center, Cloud and Data Center Management MVPs (including myself), we are also going to have some globally recognised MVPs as speakers, which will be announced at a later stage once the list is finalised. I can’t drop any names at the moment, but please believe me, based on what I know so far, you don’t want to miss this event!

The SCU APAC event is managed and organised by the Infront Consulting Group APAC team. Currently, they are offering a Christmas special for the conference pass, which is only AUD $200, which is even $50 less than the super early bird special.

You can find the details about SCU Australia from here: <a title="http://systemcenteruniverse.asia/australia/" href="http://systemcenteruniverse.asia/australia/">http://systemcenteruniverse.asia/australia/</a>

The Christmas special ends 31st December,2015. A promotional email was sent out to many people in the community few days ago. if you didn’t receive the email, you can read it here: <a title="http://burl.co/5C33A7B" href="http://burl.co/5C33A7B">http://burl.co/5C33A7B</a>
