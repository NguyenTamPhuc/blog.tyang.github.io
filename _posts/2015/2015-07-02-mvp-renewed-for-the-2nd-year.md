Time flies. It has been one year since I firstly became a MVP in System Center Cloud and Datacenter Management. Last night, I have received the most important email of the year:

<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/image.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/image_thumb.png" alt="image" width="706" height="375" border="0" /></a>

I have been renewed for another year! It has certainly been a great journey so far. I'm looking forward to another awesome year!
