Next week, I will team up with my fellow Cloud and Datacenter MVP Daniel Mar from Infront Consulting Australia and deliver 2 free Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. These events will take place at Microsoft’s Sydney and Melbourne office respectively.

We will deep dive into different aspects of OMS and demonstrate some existing and new capabilities. If you want to learn more about OMS and are based on either Sydney and Melbourne, please feel free to register and come to our workshops.
