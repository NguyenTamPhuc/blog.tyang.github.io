Few weeks ago, I presented a session on Top Community Resources for SCOM and OMS for Squared Up’s UK community workshop (<a title="https://blog.tyang.org/2015/10/05/top-community-resources-for-scom-and-oms/" href="https://blog.tyang.org/2015/10/05/top-community-resources-for-scom-and-oms/">https://blog.tyang.org/2015/10/05/top-community-resources-for-scom-and-oms/</a>). Squared Up has asked me to present this again for the broader community since it was well received by the audiences from the workshop.

So I’m going to present this session few more times. They are free to register and attend. You can find the details from Squared Up’s website: <a title="https://squaredup.com/tao-yang-presents-top-community-resources-for-scom-and-oms/" href="https://squaredup.com/tao-yang-presents-top-community-resources-for-scom-and-oms/">https://squaredup.com/tao-yang-presents-top-community-resources-for-scom-and-oms/</a>

Additionally, after the initial presentation, I notice I forgot to include some awesome resources, I will add them in this time.
