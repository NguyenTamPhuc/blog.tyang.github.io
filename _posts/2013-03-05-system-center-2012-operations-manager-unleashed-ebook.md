We’ve all been waited for so long for this book:

You might have heard that this book is already available in ebook formats from Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.

I’m sick of waiting for the paperback version that I bought last July from Amazon, it still hasn’t been shipped yet. So I went ahead and also bought the ebook.

I bought the ebook from the publisher’s website: <a title="http://www.informit.com/store/system-center-2012-operations-manager-unleashed-9780672335914" href="http://www.informit.com/store/system-center-2012-operations-manager-unleashed-9780672335914">http://www.informit.com/store/system-center-2012-operations-manager-unleashed-9780672335914</a>

Unlike Amazon, when you get from <a href="http://www.informit.com">www.informit.com</a>, you’ll get 3 versions of the ebook: epub, mobi and pdf.

Currently the price is $38.39, but for the limited time, if you use the promo code “<strong>UNLEASHED2013</strong>”, the price will reduce to $37.99 – That’s 40 cents off! what a bargain!

So for those who are getting the ebook and hasn’t made the purchase yet, I’d recommend to get from the above mentioned site as you’ll get all 3 formats:
