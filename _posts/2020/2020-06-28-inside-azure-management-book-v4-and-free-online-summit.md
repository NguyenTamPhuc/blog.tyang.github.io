To celebrate the book launch, the authors of this book (including myself), will host a one-day 16-hour free online summit on Wednesday 23rd July 2020. Come join us for a full day of deep-dive technical sessions across a variety of Microsoft cloud topics from Microsoft MVPs and special Microsoft guests. Topics will include

* DevOps and Automation
* Cyber Security
* Cloud Governance
* Migration and Monitoring
* Docker and Kubernetes
* AI and Identity

Although the final sessions are still be finalised at the moment, I can reveal mine. Back in February this year, I have co-presented a session with Alex Verkinderen (who’s also an co-author of this book) at Microsoft Ignite the Tour in Sydney. The topic we presented was called <em>Design and Implement a Monitoring Solution for Your Azure Environment Using ARM Template and CI/CD Pipelines</em>. We were going to deliver this session again this April in Singapore at the Experts Live Asia. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Experts Live Asia was cancelled this year. I have many people approached me after our Ignite talk in Sydney and asked for the recording. Unfortunately, the session was not recorded. So Alex and I have decided to deliver this session again at the Inside Azure Management virtual summit in July, with updated and improved content. It will be a level 400 session, with lots of code samples. I hope I’ll see you then!
