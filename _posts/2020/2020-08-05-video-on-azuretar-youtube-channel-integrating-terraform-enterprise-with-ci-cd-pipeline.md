Last weekend, I was invited to record a video on my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeArteiro">Jorge Arteiro</a>’s YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3FS96NUdoR3DwkaDwiLdRw">AzureTar</a>. In this video, I have demonstrated some POC code I was working on during my spare time over the last month or so – Integrating Azure DevOps and Terraform Enterprise (or Terraform Cloud). I’ve demonstrated how to use my newly published PowerShell module tfe (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/tfe/">PSGallery</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tyconsulting/TerraformEnterprise-PS">GitHub</a>) to drive Terraform Enterprise deployment as part of your CI/CD Pipeline.

I’d like to thank the AzureTar hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeArteiro">Jorge</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FernandoRolnik">Fernando</a> for having me. I’m looking forward to recording more video with them in the future.
