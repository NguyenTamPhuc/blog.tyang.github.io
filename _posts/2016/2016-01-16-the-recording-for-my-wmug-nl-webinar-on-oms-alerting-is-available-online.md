Earlier this week, I have presented for a webinar hosted by WMUG NL (Windows Management User Group Netherlands). The topic is Introduction to OMS Alerting. The recording and the slide deck is now available online. You can find them here: <a title="http://wmug.nl/2016/01/15/recording-wmug-nl-webinar-6-2016-online-introduction-to-operational-management-suite-oms-alerting/" href="http://wmug.nl/2016/01/15/recording-wmug-nl-webinar-6-2016-online-introduction-to-operational-management-suite-oms-alerting/">http://wmug.nl/2016/01/15/recording-wmug-nl-webinar-6-2016-online-introduction-to-operational-management-suite-oms-alerting/</a>

Iâ€™d like to thank everyone who has attended the webinar, and also big thanks the the event organiser and my fellow CDM MVP Kenneth van Surksum (<a href="https://twitter.com/kennethvs">@kennethvs</a>).
