Over the last few months, I have been a bit quiet on this blog, because I was involved in a book project together with Pete Zerger (<a href="https://twitter.com/pzerger">@pzerger</a>), Stanislav Zhelyazkov (<a href="https://twitter.com/StanZhelyazkov">@StanZhelyazkov</a>) and Anders Bengtsson (<a title="http://contoso.se/blog/" href="http://contoso.se/blog/">http://contoso.se/blog/</a>).

The book is titled **Inside the Microsoft Operations Management Suite**, and we have made it freely available to the community.

We wanted to bring a learning resource for the MS Operations Management Suite to the community that is complete, comprehensive, conciseâ€¦and free (as in beer). While we finish final editing passes over the next couple of weeks, we wanted to share an early copy of the book so you can start digging in while we finish our work!
