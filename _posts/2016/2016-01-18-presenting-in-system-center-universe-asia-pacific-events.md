As you may have already heard, the biggest System Center community event System Center Universe (SCU) is coming to Melbourne this year. SCU APAC will host a 2-day event in KL, Malaysia followed by a 1-day event in Melbourne. The Malaysian event will be hosted on Tuesday and Wednesday 8th-9th March and the Melbourne event will be hosted on Friday 11th March at <a href="https://www.crownmelbourne.com.au/">Crown Casino</a>.

There will be many Cloud & Data Center MVPs, Hyper-V MVPs including many international speakers attending both events. The session information will be published soon, but let me assure you that attendees will not be disappointed based on what I already know. Additionally, I will co-present 2 sessions with my friends and CDM MVPs Alex Verkinderen (<a href="https://twitter.com/AlexVerkinderen">@AlexVerkinderen</a>) and Pete Zerger (<a href="https://twitter.com/pzerger">@pzerger</a>):

* Be a hero and save the day with OMS and Power BI (co-Present with: Alex Verkinderen)
* Modernizing Your Automation Strategy with Azure Automation and OMS (co-present with Pete Zerger)

The Melbourne event organiser, my MVP buddy Daniel Mar (<a href="https://twitter.com/barkerboy8">@barkerboy8</a>) from Infront Consulting has asked me to help with promoting this event, and there is currently an Australian Day promotion at AUD $250 per ticket, which is discounted $50 from the normal price of $300. You will also get an additional 10% off if you get 5 or more tickets (which brings down the price to $225 per ticket). You can take advantage of this promotion by following this link: <a href="https://systemcenteruniverseaustralia2016.eventbrite.com/?discount=OZDAY">https://systemcenteruniverseaustralia2016.eventbrite.com/?discount=OZDAY</a>
