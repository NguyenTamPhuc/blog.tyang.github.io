If you are a regular visitor of this blog, you may have noticed that this blog has been down since last Thursday, and I’ve only been able to get it back online few hours ago (Monday afternoon my time). The downtime was caused by the server which is hosting my blog. My hoster couldn’t recover the sever, and ended up restored my site from the backup (that they took on 24th April, which was 3 weeks ago).

Due to the hoster’s lack of ability to maintain my site, I have lost 3 weeks of data (2 most recent blog posts, comments, etc.). Only until today after I talked to their technical support people on the phone, I found out that they only backup my site once a week (and the recent backups were corrupted).

Putting my emotion aside, I have managed to find the Windows Live Writer’s drafts for the 2 blog posts that I lost, and I have just re-published them. I made sure the URLs are still the same as the original ones, but you may see them appear in your RSS feeds again (as duplicate feeds). Also, if you have left any comments on my blog over the last 3 weeks, they are probably gone now.

I apologise for any inconvenience this outage may have caused. I am looking into my own WordPress backup solutions now.

Also, my hosting plan is due for renewal in about a month time, I think I’ve got do something about it :smiley:
