I’m teaming up with Infront Consulting, Australia and will deliver a 4-day in-person instructor-led SCOM 2012 bootcamp at Melbourne, Australia. The content of this bootcamp was developed by Infront Consulting group and it has been very popular internationally.

This bootcamp is designed for SCOM administrators and operators. If you are running SCOM (or planning to implement SCOM) in your environment, I strongly recommend you enrol to this bootcamp and spend 4 days with myself and other folks attending the bootcamp.

Here’s the detail of this training event:
