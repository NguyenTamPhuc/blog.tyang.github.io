Last week, I have conducted a workshop with Richard Benwell from Squared Up to a group of Squared Up’s customers at an internal company event. In the workshop, I led the students and built a sealed OpsMgr management pack with a simple agent task.

After the workshop, our plan is to make the content available to general public, therefore, Richard and I will be conducting 2 additional webinars next week to cover different time zones. We will repeat what we did in last week’s internal event, and demonstrate how to build such a MP from scratch using VSAE and Visual Studio 2015. This is an absolute beginner’s guide to authoring management packs using VSAE. As you will see, we are writing the entire MP in Visual Studio without having to type any XML code!

If you are interested in this topic, please feel free to pick a time that’s suitable to you from the registration page below:

Lastly, the workshop guide, and a sample completed Visual Studio project can be found in this GitHub repo: <a title="https://github.com/tyconsulting/SquaredUp-VSAE-Workshop" href="https://github.com/tyconsulting/SquaredUp-VSAE-Workshop">https://github.com/tyconsulting/SquaredUp-VSAE-Workshop</a>.

If you’d like to build the MP during the webinar with us, there are some pre-requisites that you must complete the steps outlined in section of the workshop guide before attending to the webinar.

Looking forward to seeing you next week!
