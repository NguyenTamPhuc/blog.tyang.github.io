<a href="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Full-Logo-Raw-short.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4909" src="http://blog.tyang.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Full-Logo-Raw-short-277x300.png" alt="Full Logo Raw short" width="139" height="151" /></a><span style="font-size: small;">Things have been pretty busy for me recently. Over the last month, I have attended Microsoft Ignite Australia and co-presented a session on Azure Automation, while still working on a book on OMS with few other authors (which we will announce very soon). I've also been very busy preparing for an OMS workshop which is going to take place this Friday. While I’m currently sitting on a couch in the car dealer waiting for my car to get serviced, I finally found sometime today for this post that I’ve been wanting to write for a few weeks.</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">After I started flying solo back in May this year, I’ve been contracted by Squared Up for 6 months. As of end of October, I have finished my contract with Squared Up. As the result, I’m now available for new opportunities. So for everyone out there, if you have opportunities in System Center, OMS and cloud space and believe that I could be of any help, please feel free to contact me via email. My contact information can be found from the Contact page of this blog (<a title="http://blog.tyang.org/contact/" href="http://blog.tyang.org/contact/">http://blog.tyang.org/contact/</a>) , and also from my company website: <a href="http://www.tyconsulting.com.au/contact-us/">http://www.tyconsulting.com.au/contact-us/</a></span>

I’m looking forward to speaking to you and discussing potential opportunities!

Cheers

Tao
