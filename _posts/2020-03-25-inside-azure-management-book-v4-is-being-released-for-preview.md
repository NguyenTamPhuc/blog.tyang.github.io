Few years ago, few of us started a book authoring project for then-called Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS). Since the technology is constantly evolving, we have renamed the book to Inside Azure Management on version 3 last year.

We have started working on version 4 of the Inside Azure Management book couple of months ago.This time, we have sourced few additional talented authors to help out.

Given the challenging time we are all facing right now, we are a little bit behind the original schedule. However, we are expecting to have the book released no later than 15th of May 2020. We will offer this book as a free download, as well as a Kindle version on Amazon if you want to support us (largely for covering the cost of the editor). You can pre-order the Kindle version <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086CC2YGX/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_Mx4EEb20QMRQW">HERE</a>.

We are planning to release several chapters for preview over the coming days. Today, we are pleased to announce the first preview chapter (Chapter 2 - Azure Governance) is released. You can download for free for <a href="https://www.insidethemicrosoftcloud.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>.

We will keep you updated as the preview and final version progresses.

I hope you will enjoy this book, and most importantly, stay safe!
